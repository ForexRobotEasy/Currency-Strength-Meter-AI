# Currency Strength Meter AI

This code is a sample implementation of a Currency Strength Meter AI, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The Currency Strength Meter AI is designed to calculate the strength of different currencies in real-time and recommend the top tradeable currencies based on their strength.

## Functionality

The code consists of several functions and structures that work together to analyze market data, calculate currency strength, and recommend tradeable currencies. Here is an overview of the key components:

### Libraries

The necessary libraries, `<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, and `<string.h>`, are imported to provide functionality for input/output operations, memory allocation, and string manipulation.

### Constants

The code defines two constants:
- `NUM_CURRENCIES`: The number of currencies to analyze. In this case, it is set to 4.
- `MAX_DATA_SIZE`: The maximum size of the market data array. In this case, it is set to 1000.

### Currency Structure

A structure named `Currency` is defined to store currency data. It has two members:
- `name`: A character array to store the name of the currency.
- `strength`: A floating-point value to store the calculated strength of the currency.

### calculateCurrencyStrength Function

This function takes an array of market data and its size as input. It is responsible for implementing an AI-based machine learning algorithm to calculate the currency strength. The algorithm utilizes real-time market data to determine the strength value. The function returns the calculated strength value as a floating-point number.

### recommendTradeableCurrencies Function

This function takes an array of `Currency` structures and its size as input. It implements a proprietary system to recommend the top 4 tradeable currencies. It updates the strength value of each currency accordingly.

### processData Function

This function takes an array of market data, an array of `Currency` structures, and their respective sizes as input. It is responsible for processing the real-time data and updating the currency strength. It calls the `calculateCurrencyStrength` function to calculate the strength value and then updates the strength value of each currency in the `Currency` array.

### main Function

The `main` function serves as the entry point of the code. It declares an array `marketData` to store the market data and an array `currencies` to store the `Currency` structures. It reads the market data from a source (e.g., API or file) and initializes the `currencies` array with the names of four currencies: USD, EUR, GBP, and JPY.

Next, it calls the `processData` function to process the real-time data and update the currency strength. Then, it calls the `recommendTradeableCurrencies` function to recommend the top tradeable currencies. Finally, it displays the currency strength and recommendations by iterating over the `currencies` array.

## Product Description

The Currency Strength Meter AI is a powerful tool designed to analyze the strength of different currencies in real-time. It utilizes an AI-based machine learning algorithm to calculate the strength value of each currency, providing traders with valuable insights for making informed trading decisions.

With the Currency Strength Meter AI, traders can easily identify the top tradeable currencies based on their strength. The proprietary system implemented in the tool recommends the four strongest currencies, allowing traders to focus on the most lucrative trading opportunities.
